-----------------------------
What are Cookies?

- Cookies are data that browsers store in small text files on your computer.

- Cookies were invented to solve the problem of "how to remember information about the user?". 

- When you sign in to a web application like CyberTalents, you won’t need to type your email and password again next time because it stores your credentials in the cookies. 

- Cookies are saved in name-value pairs like:
  
   username = user 

- When a browser requests a web page from a server, cookies belonging to the page are added to the request. 
   
- This way the server gets the necessary data to "remember" information about users. 

-----------------------------

3. Cookies Manipulation (Read, Change, and Delete)

- Create a Cookie with JavaScript

JavaScript can create, read, and delete cookies with the document.cookie property.

With JavaScript, a cookie can be created like this:

==============
code : make cookie
document.cookie = "username = user";
==============

You can also add an expiry date (in UTC time). By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed:

==============
code : add the expire time 
document.cookie = "username = user ; expire=thu,18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC";
==============


- With a path parameter, you can tell the browser what path the cookie belongs to. 
- By default, the cookie belongs to the current page


1- The url path prefix must be absolute. 
2- It makes the cookie accessible for pages under that path. By default, it’s the current path.

3- If a cookie is set with path=/admin, it’s visible at pages /admin and /admin/something, but not at /home or /adminpage.

4- Usually, we should set path to the root: path=/ to make the cookie accessible from all website pages.

==============
code : add the expire time 
document.cookie = "username = user ; expire=thu,18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC;path=/";
==============


=> Read a Cookie with JavaScript


==============
code : read cookie 
var cookie = document.cookie;
==============



=> Change a Cookie with JavaScript

With JavaScript, you can change a cookie the same way as you create it:
==============
code : add the expire time 
document.cookie = "username = test ; expire=thu,18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC;path=/";
==============



=> Delete a Cookie with JavaScript

Deleting a cookie is very simple. You don't have to specify a cookie value when you delete a cookie. 

Just set the expires parameter to a passed date:


==============
code : add the expire time 
document.cookie = "username = test ; expire=thu,18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC;path=/";
==============

-----------------------------
 A Function to Set a Cookie

First, we create a function that stores the name of the visitor in a cookie variable:
==============

code : function that set a cookie
function setCookie(name, value, expireDays) {
  var date = new Date();
  date.setTime(date.getTime() + (expireDays * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
  var expires = "expires=" + date.toUTCString();
  document.cookie = name + "=" + value + ";" + expires + ";path=/";
}
==============



to solve the challenge 

- first do inspect then u can find the user-name and password for support and the sign in 

- then  go to the storage and change the cookie of the role value and again sent the request .
